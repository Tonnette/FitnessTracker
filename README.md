# FitnessTracker

In this app the user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they can track the distance traveled.

The user can:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the statistics of their exercises on the `stats` page.
